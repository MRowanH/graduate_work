0	A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
1	[1] Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems.
2	The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights.
3	A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections.
4	All inputs are modified by a weight and summed.
5	This activity is referred to as a linear combination.
6	Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output.
7	For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be âˆ’1 and 1.
8	These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset.
9	Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.
