This is because the number of possible n-grams consist of every combination of unigrams possible (e.g. he likes cat, he cat likes, likes he cat, likes cat he, cat he likes, cat likes he). Even though most of these n-grams don't occur, the probabilities for them need to be calculated and storage space needs to be assigned. Given that so many never occur, this is often wasted storage space and computational power. On top of this, looking at the n-grams in the text is more computationally expesive for larger n values because as n increases, we visit each token in a string more often (e.g. for \"likes\"; unigram: occurs in window \"likes\", bigram: occurs in windows \"he likes\" and \"likes cats\", trigram: occurs in all windows in previous e.g.).
