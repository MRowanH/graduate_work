style.txt

this is a style guide for the project - contribute your ideas, strong opinions, and hot-takes for how code 
should be written.
The top of every code file should contain some sort of description like you see here.

class NamesShouldBeCamelCased():
    def functions_should_be_snake_cased() -> None:
        variables_are_also_snake_cased = 1


# function parameters should have typehints
def some_function(f: float, i: int) -> None:  # functions should have return types
    i = 1  # end of line comments should have two spaces before the comments
    ...

# block comments can be 
# a lot of pounds
''' or the python
block comment
your choice '''

# docstrings should be avoided - put your comments up here
def documentation()
    ...  # inside the function body is for code, not the docs


VALUES_MEANT_TO_BE_CONSTANT_SHOULD_BE_ALL_CAPS = "don't change me"

TODO (who): has to do this thing is how we will keep in-code todos
TODO: this can be done by anyone
NOTE: is a good way to empasize that something worth explaining is happening
FIXME: is fine... but why don't you just fix it?
